# FADE-MAS2D
We introduce a FADE-MAS2D platform approach for simulating soil methane emission suppression control using swarming UAVs that spread biochar mulch based on fractional anomalous diffusion with wind field.
## Usage
run the following command to implement simulation process.
```
simstart_v2.m
```
